## Assignments
Calculator App as set of NodeJS modules

Must be completed before next session

### Synopsis
Write a node.js program for a simple functional math basic operations and break them in to modules, write test cases to test the modules

### Code structure & Submission
- You will have to submit in Hobbes for evaluation and feedback, submitting any number of times is fine, try and get 100%
- A seed code for this assignment is provided here, https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/stack_nodejs/calculator_module_app without which you will struggle submitting in Hobbes
- Fork from this project but with a different name, try prefixing your forked project with your name and assignment number `<YourName>_Week01_<whatever the rest you  want to name it>`

### Objective
- Should be able code using NodeJS, develop modules of own, allowed to use any external module only if necessary and significantly improve the code
- Follow proper Language semantics, like naming variables, functions, files etc.,
- Use modules to modularize the code
- Practice TDD by writing test cases using Mocha framework and Chai style of assertions
- Include necessary scripts in package.json for running test cases, to run lint checks
- Take care of adding modules as devDependency and dependency correctly
- Avoid using ES5 language semantics, try as much as ES6
